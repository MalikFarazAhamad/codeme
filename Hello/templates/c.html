                <b>C</b> is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the<b> 1970s by Dennis Ritchie</b>, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly for application software. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.<b>Since 2000</b>, C has consistently ranked among the top two languages in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages.

            <p>
                C is an imperative, procedural language in the ALGOL tradition. It has a static type system. In C, all executable code is contained within subroutines (also called "functions", though not in the sense of functional programming). Function parameters are passed by value, although arrays are passed as pointers, i.e. the address of the first item in the array. Pass-by-reference is simulated in C by explicitly passing pointers to the thing being referenced.C program source text is free-form code. The semicolon separates statements and curly braces are used for grouping blocks of statements.
             <p>
                The C language also exhibits the following characteristics
             </p>
             <ul>
                <li>The language has a small, fixed number of keywords, including a full set of control flow primitives: <b>if/else</b>, <b>for</b>, <b>do/while</b>, <b>while</b>, and <b>switch</b>. User-defined names are not distinguished from keywords by any kind of sigil.</li>
                <li>It has a large number of arithmetic, bitwise, and logic operators: <b>+</b>,<b>+=</b>,<b>++</b>,<b>&</b>,<b>||</b>, etc.</li>
                <li>More than one assignment may be performed in a single statement.</li>
                <li>Function</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Function return values can be ignored, when not needed.</li>
                    <li>Function and data pointers permit ad hoc run-time polymorphism.</li>
                    <li>Functions may not be defined within the lexical scope of other functions.</li>
                    <li>ariables may be defined within a function, with scope.</li>
                    <li>A function may call itself, so recursion is supported.</li>
                </ul>
             </ul>

                Many later languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C, including C++, C#, Unix's C shell, D, Go, Java, JavaScript (including transpilers), Julia, Limbo, LPC, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Swift, Verilog and SystemVerilog (hardware description languages).[5] These languages have drawn many of their control structures and other basic features from C. Most of them (Python being a dramatic exception) also express highly similar syntax to C, and they tend to combine the recognizable expression and statement syntax of C with underlying type systems, data models, and semantics that can be radically different.

                <h5>Early developments</h5>
                The origin of C is closely tied to the development of the Unix operating system, originally implemented in assembly language on a PDP-7 by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, incorporating several ideas from colleagues. Eventually, they decided to port the operating system to a PDP-11. The original PDP-11 version of Unix was also developed in assembly language.
                <h5>B</h5>
                Thompson wanted a programming language for developing utilities for the new platform. At first, he tried to write a Fortran compiler, but soon gave up the idea. Instead, he created a cut-down version of the recently developed BCPL systems programming language. The official description of BCPL was not available at the time[13] and Thompson modified the syntax to be less wordy, and similar to a simplified ALGOL known as SMALGOL.Thompson called the result B.He described B as "BCPL semantics with a lot of SMALGOL syntax".Like BCPL, B had a bootstrapping compiler to facilitate porting to new machines.However, few utilities were ultimately written in B because it was too slow, and could not take advantage of PDP-11 features such as byte addressability.

            <p>
                In 1971, Ritchie started to improve B, to utilise the features of the more-powerful PDP-11. A significant addition was a character data type. He called this New B (NB).Thompson started to use NB to write the Unix kernel, and his requirements shaped the direction of the language development.Through to 1972, richer types were added to the NB language: NB had arrays of int and char. Pointers, the ability to generate pointers to other types, arrays of all types, and types to be returned from functions were all also added. Arrays within expressions became pointers. A new compiler was written, and the language was renamed C.The C compiler and some utilities made with it were included in Version 2 Unix, which is also known as Research Unix.

                C has a formal grammar specified by the C standard.Line endings are generally not significant in C; however, line boundaries do have significance during the preprocessing phase. Comments may appear either between the delimiters <b>/*</b> and <b>*/</b>, or (since C99) following <b>//</b> until the end of the line. Comments delimited by<b> /* </b> <b>/*</b> do not nest, and these sequences of characters are not interpreted as comment delimiters if they appear inside string or character literals.C source files contain declarations and function definitions. Function definitions, in turn, contain declarations and statements. Declarations either define new types using keywords such as struct, union, and enum, or assign types to and perhaps reserve storage for new variables, usually by writing the type followed by the variable name. Keywords such as char and int specify built-in types. Sections of code are enclosed in braces ({ and }, sometimes called "curly brackets") to limit the scope of declarations and to act as a single statement for control structures.As an imperative language, C uses statements to specify actions. The most common statement is an expression statement, consisting of an expression to be evaluated, followed by a semicolon; as a side effect of the evaluation, functions may be called and variables may be assigned new values. To modify the normal sequential execution of statements, C provides several control-flow statements identified by reserved keywords. Structured programming is supported by <b>if ... [else] </b>conditional execution and by do ... while, while, and for iterative execution (looping). The for statement has separate initialization, testing, and reinitialization expressions, any or all of which can be omitted. break and continue can be used within the loop. Break is used to leave the innermost enclosing loop statement and continue is used to skip to its reinitialisation. There is also a non-structured goto statement which branches directly to the designated label within the function. switch selects a case to be executed based on the value of an integer expression. Different from many other languages, control-flow will fall through to the next case unless terminated by a break.Expressions can use a variety of built-in operators and may contain function calls. The order in which arguments to functions and operands to most operators are evaluated is unspecified. The evaluations may even be interleaved. However, all side effects (including storage to variables) will occur before the next "sequence point"; sequence points include the end of each expression statement, and the entry to and return from each function call. Sequence points also occur during evaluation of expressions containing certain operators (<b>&&, ||, ?:</b> and the comma operator). This permits a high degree of object code optimization by the compiler, but requires C programmers to take more care to obtain reliable results than is needed for other programming languages.Kernighan and Ritchie say in the Introduction of The C Programming Language: "C, like any other language, has its blemishes. Some of the operators have the wrong precedence; some parts of the syntax could be better." The C standard did not attempt to correct many of these blemishes, because of the impact of such changes on already existing software.

                C has both directly and indirectly influenced many later languages such as C++, C#, D, Go, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Rust and Unix's C shell.[56] The most pervasive influence has been syntactical; all of the languages mentioned combine the statement and (more or less recognizably) expression syntax of C with type systems, data models or large-scale program structures that differ from those of C, sometimes radically.Several C or near-C interpreters exist, including Ch and CINT, which can also be used for scripting.When object-oriented programming languages became popular, C++ and Objective-C were two different extensions of C that provided object-oriented capabilities. Both languages were originally implemented as source-to-source compilers; source code was translated into C, and then compiled with a C compiler The C++ programming language (originally named "C with Classes") was devised by Bjarne Stroustrup as an approach to providing object-oriented functionality with a C-like syntax.C++ adds greater typing strength, scoping, and other tools useful in object-oriented programming, and permits generic programming via templates. Nearly a superset of C, C++ now supports most of C, with a few exceptions.Objective-C was originally a very "thin" layer on top of C, and remains a strict superset of C that permits object-oriented programming using a hybrid dynamic/static typing paradigm. Objective-C derives its syntax from both C and Smalltalk: syntax that involves preprocessing, expressions, function declarations, and function calls is inherited from C, while the syntax for object-oriented features was originally taken from Smalltalk.In addition to C++ and Objective-C, Ch, Cilk, and Unified Parallel C are nearly supersets of C.</p>
